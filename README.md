# Vendor Performance Analysis

A comprehensive data analytics project that analyzes vendor performance using Python, SQL, and Power BI to provide actionable business insights for procurement optimization.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes vendor performance across multiple dimensions including sales effectiveness, profit margins, inventory turnover, and purchase contribution. The analysis helps optimize vendor relationships and improve business profitability through data-driven insights.

## Key Results

- Total Sales Revenue: $441.41 Million
- Total Purchase Value: $307.34 Million
- Gross Profit Generated: $134.07 Million
- Average Profit Margin: 38.7%
- Unsold Capital: $2.71 Million
- Active Vendors Analyzed: 156+

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- SQLite for data storage
- Power BI for interactive dashboards
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis

## Key Findings

1. **Vendor Concentration Risk**: Top 10 vendors account for 65.7% of purchases
2. **Bulk Purchase Benefits**: 72% cost reduction through volume purchasing
3. **Performance Paradox**: Low-volume vendors maintain higher profit margins
4. **Inventory Optimization**: $2.71M capital optimization opportunity

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy`
3. Run data ingestion: `python ingestion_db.py`
4. Open analysis notebooks in Jupyter
5. View Power BI dashboard in Power BI Desktop

## Analysis Workflow

1. Data ingestion and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Vendor performance metrics calculation
4. Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
5. Interactive dashboard development

## Business Recommendations

- Implement vendor diversification strategy
- Optimize inventory management ($710K improvement potential)
- Develop bulk purchase incentive programs
- Focus on high-margin, low-volume vendor development
